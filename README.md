# audio-quality-analysis
Example code for analysis of perceptual attribute ratings and audio signal features as part of the Cadenza CAD1 Challenge.

This repo contains an R script which imports a dataset containing perceptual attribute ratings for audio quality, and audio signal features of music samples processed by machine learning systems for listeners with a hearing impairment.

Alongside this R script, there is an R markdown file and corresponding .html document, for an immediate sense of the outputs from the R script.
